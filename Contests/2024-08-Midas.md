## [M-01] Corruptible Upgradability Pattern

### Summary

The Midas protocol's upgrade mechanism is at risk due to potential storage layout conflicts in its inheritance structure. This issue stems from the absence of storage gaps in key base contracts.

### Vulnerability Detail

Within the Midas ecosystem, several foundational contracts lack proper storage gap implementation. These include:

1. Pausable
2. CustomAggregatorV3CompatibleFeed
3. WithSanctionsList

The above mentioned inherited by contracts with initializer Upgradable pattern or contains initializer itself like (`CustomAggregatorV3CompatibleFeed`)  
These contracts serve as building blocks for more complex contracts like `MTBillCustomAggregatorFeed`, `DepositVault`, and `RedemptionVault`. The absence of storage gaps creates a domino effect, potentially compromising the entire upgrade process.

The intricate inheritance web exacerbates this issue. Each base contract not only affects its direct descendants but also creates a ripple effect through the entire contract hierarchy.

The absence of storage gaps in these contracts creates a vulnerability where introducing new storage variables could lead to storage collision. This collision may corrupt the initial storage layout of derived contracts, potentially triggering severe malfunctions throughout the system's operations.

### Impact

The ramifications of this vulnerability are severe:

1. Storage Corruption: During upgrades, new variables added to base contracts could overwrite existing storage in derived contracts.
2. Functional Breakdown: Critical system functions may behave erratically or fail completely post-upgrade.

### Tool used

Manual Review

### Recommendation

for pausable contracts, if the mapping storage is not necessary, try to remove it or implement it in the pausable-Upgradable contract na shift the gap to be `48` instead of `49`  
other contracts mentioned, add for them the Gap as needed

## [M-02] Variation from The link pointing to invariants and the actual implementation

### Summary

The specification document referenced in the project README outlines a specific edge case scenario and requests certain implementations. However, these requirements are not reflected in the current codebase, potentially compromising one of the system's key invariants.

### Vulnerability Detail

The project README directs attention to a specification document, stating:

_Chapter_ (Special Contract Version) User can instantly redeem mTBILL for USDC pulled from BUIDL:

**Edge case**

- Redeem the full BUIDL balance in the smartcontract if the BUIDL balance will be less than 250k post transaction (as 250k is the minimum). Make this **250k threshold a parameter** that can be adjusted by the admin

Upon examination of the `RedemptionVaultWIthBUIDL` contract, it becomes apparent that the edge case described in the specification is not implemented. Furthermore, there is no mechanism to adjust the threshold as stipulated in the requirements.

### Impact

unintended behavior and breakage of functionality when the minimum threshold is exceeded and not handled
